## Overview

This repository contains a full Python implementation of the **Jaya Algorithm**, a simple yet powerful **Evolutionary Computation algorithm** for solving optimization problems.  
The Jaya Algorithm is parameter-free (no algorithm-specific tuning parameters) and works by **moving solutions toward the best and away from the worst** in each iteration.

## Features

- Minimize any user-defined objective function
- Easy-to-use and fully parameterized
- Visualize convergence over iterations
- Suitable for academic projects, tutorials, and research
